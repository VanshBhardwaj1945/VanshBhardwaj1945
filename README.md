## About Me

My journey into technology started with curiosity — breaking things in labs, rebuilding them correctly, and wanting to understand how systems actually work under the hood. What began as learning networking and security fundamentals evolved into building full cloud-based systems and then asking the harder question: how do you design them securely from the start?

I enjoy building infrastructure from the ground up — deploying it, automating it, monitoring it, and stress-testing it to see where it fails. Whether it’s a cloud-hosted application, a detection lab, or a CI/CD pipeline, I like understanding every layer involved.

Over time, I’ve become especially interested in the intersection of infrastructure, automation, and security — where engineering decisions directly impact reliability, resilience, and risk.

Right now, I’m focused on deepening my knowledge of cloud platforms, infrastructure-as-code, system hardening, and detection-driven engineering while continuing to build hands-on, production-style projects.

**Core focus areas:**
- Cloud security and secure cloud infrastructure
- DevSecOps: automation, CI/CD, and test-gated deployments
- Detection engineering and log-driven incident validation
- Infrastructure automation and reproducible lab environments
