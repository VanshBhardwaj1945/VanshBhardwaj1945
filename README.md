## About

My journey began with curiosity — breaking lab setups, rebuilding them correctly, and learning how systems behave under stress. That curiosity led me from networking and core security fundamentals into building cloud-hosted systems and asking how to design them securely from day one.

I enjoy building infrastructure end-to-end: deploy, automate, monitor, and stress-test until it’s reliable and observable. I focus on automation, test-gated deployments, and telemetry-driven validation so systems remain resilient as they scale.

**Core focus areas**
- Cloud security and secure cloud infrastructure  
- DevSecOps: automation, CI/CD, test-gated deployments  
- Detection engineering and log-driven incident validation  
- Infrastructure automation and reproducible lab environments

## Projects

| Project | What I Built | Security + Cloud Impact | Technologies |
|---|---|---|---|
| **[Cloud-Native Resume Platform (Featured)](https://github.com/VanshBhardwaj1945/cloud-resume-challenge-azure)** | - Designed and deployed a serverless cloud resume application on Microsoft Azure<br>- Implemented full-stack architecture using frontend → serverless API → database separation<br>- Built and automated CI/CD deployment pipelines with testing validation | - Reduced production deployment risk using automated CI/CD workflows<br>- Secured backend data access using API abstraction and identity separation<br>- Improved availability using CDN-style edge routing and HTTPS security | Microsoft Azure (Storage, Front Door, Functions, Cosmos DB), GitHub, GitHub Actions Workflows, Python, pytest, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Cloudflare DNS, Azure CLI, Azure Portal, Docker (local environments), Git version control |
| **[Application-Layer DoS Detection Lab (Slowloris)](https://github.com/VanshBhardwaj1945/slowloris-dos-attack-lab-)** | - Executed controlled Slowloris testing in an isolated sandbox<br>- Built SIEM ingestion and detection queries for Apache logs<br>- Performed packet- and host-level telemetry analysis | - Demonstrated detection engineering for low-bandwidth app-layer attacks<br>- Validated failure modes not visible to network-volume monitoring | Splunk, Apache, Wireshark, Nmap, Kali |
| **[Network Segmentation & Firewall Policy Lab](https://github.com/VanshBhardwaj1945/Project-1-Sandbox-Firewall-Access-Control-CS4371-CS5378)** | - Designed multi-subnet virtualization topology and routing policies<br>- Implemented router (pfSense) and host (iptables) controls | - Enforced least-privilege communication rules to reduce lateral movement risk<br>- Verified enforcement with active scanning and packet captures | VirtualBox, pfSense, iptables, Nmap, Wireshark |
